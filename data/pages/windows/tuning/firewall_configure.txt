It's a matter of fact that modern computer systems are insecure - viruses, malicious actors, Trojan programs, etc. are always trying to breach into our systems using known and yet unpublished bugs in OS and services. MS Windows has a long history of [[https://www.quertime.com/article/15-deadly-windows-security-flaws-and-vulnerabilities/|security flows]] and vulnerabilities, more than [[https://www.cvedetails.com/product/32238/Microsoft-Windows-10.html?vendor_id=26|hundred bugs]] are discovered each year in the system. You may install a honeypot from this nice [[https://github.com/paralax/awesome-honeypots|list]] and assign it a white IP to get an idea of how aggressive are attempts of breaching into your system. 

If you think that your rigs are protected by your NAT((https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation)) router then think twice (credits [[https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2018/11/mass-router-hack-exposes-millions-of-devices-to-potent-nsa-exploit/|arstechnica.com]]): 
<code>(11/29/2018) More than 45,000 Internet routers have been compromised by a newly discovered campaign thatâ€™s designed to open networks to attacks by EternalBlue, the potent exploit that was developed by, and then stolen from, the National Security Agency and leaked to the Internet at large, researchers said Wednesday... As a result, almost 2 million computers, phones, and other network devices connected to the routers are reachable to the Internet on those ports.

==== Configuring Windows Defender Firewall ====

Unfortunately, a computer connected by Ethernet((https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet)) cable to a network can't be 100% secured, there is always a risk of being compromised, but we may lower the risk by protecting our system by the mean of Windows Defender Firewall((https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Firewall))

Consider the quote below (credits [[https://support.rackspace.com/how-to/best-practices-for-firewall-rules-configuration/|rackspace.com]] //Best practices for firewall rules configuration//):
<code>Block all traffic by default and explicitly allow only specific traffic to known services. This strategy provides good control over the traffic and reduces the possibility of a breach because of service misconfiguration.</code>

I'm totally agree with it. We'll configure windows firewall in exactly the same way - block all inbound connections and add rules for allowing selected services to be able accept incoming packets. Note: services such as TeamViewer, RDP, etc. will be not affected, they will continue working as before.
