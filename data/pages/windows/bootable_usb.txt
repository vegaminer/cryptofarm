There are dozens of tools which may be used for creating bootable USB drives, but my favorite one is Rufus. This is free and open source project hosted at [[https://github.com/pbatard/rufus|github]].

<note>Technically speaking, it's not a burning, since we don't use laser for it, but historically writing an ISO file to a media was always a //burning// for me, so I'm using this term here.</note>

**STEP 2.** Burning ISO

You'll need an USB drive of appropriate size. Most of 4GB sticks have enough space to hold Windows ISO, but once I had a 4GB stick which was 500 bytes less. Anyway, rufus will check available capacity of your USB drive and report to you if it's impossible to fit ISO into it.

Insert USB stick into your PC and start rufus tool
  - Click ''"Select"'' button
  - Navigate to saved Windows ISO file (see [[:windows:media_creation_tool|media creation tool]])
  - Click ''"Start"'' button

**STEP 3.** Download FireFox and rigutils.zip

I recommend to disconnect your PC during Windows installation procedure. Having full version of FireFox setup executable and rigutils.zip on the same USB drive may help you in reducing the time you spend on your rig configuration. Download FireFox by following this [[:windows:software:firefox#full|instruction]] and rigutils.zip by following [[:windows:rigutils:install|this one]].
